With a background from being involved in the early days of the web industry and then developing interactive Flash based software for training and development, I’m now looking to move towards backend development using C# and ASP.Net.</p>
            <p class="aboutStyling">I’m a huge believer that you never stop learning and have recently self-funded myself through the Just IT Developer Professional course. This has reignited my passion for development and taught me a lot about modern programming and development which I’m now looking to use to build my career.</p>
            <p class="aboutStyling">Though primarily looking towards developing in C#, I also have a keen interest in cross-platform technologies and always look towards finding the best solution, whether this be developing solutions for business based projects or programming for fun at home, I like to find elegant solutions to any problems I come across.</p>
            <p class="aboutStyling">When I’m not coding I have a keen interest in modern art and design, enjoy visiting museums and exhibitions and like to attend gigs and festivals whenever possible. I also grew up on a farm so enjoy getting back to nature sometimes whether that’s on foot or on my bike.</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>ASP.Net MVC</li>

                                    <h3>What I Learnt From This Project</h3>
                                    <p>I really felt that this project gave me a better understanding of how the whole Model View Controller idea of programming works. I really enjoyed developing the system and getting it to a stage where I could have the orders sent via email. I now feel a lot more comfortable with MVC now and also understand how the system works in ASP.Net. I also feel that I’ve got very good at debugging in ASP.Net during this project and have been able to quickly find and fix bugs from the stack trace.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Issues I Faced</h3>
                                    <p>With this project the main issues I faced were of my own doing as I spent a lot of time trying different approaches to MVC and took the time to understand how the code first approach works and how you can easily expand on projects written this way. Though I could have done this in a quicker and easier way I do feel that learning this standard and the experimenting this way gave me a really good platform to expand my knowledge of the concept.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>What I Would Do To Expand This Concept</h3>
                                    <p>Currently the system is only taking the orders and sending them by email so the first expansion would be to build a customer section where people could register and track their orders. From here I would like to build more of the backend system as to how those orders would be handled and shown alongside an accounting system to show volume of sales across the site.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>This really is more of a proof of concept system built to show my ability within C# ASP.Net MVC and if this system was to become a full system handling customers, payments and orders then I would expand it a great deal so that it could be fully adaptable to any businesses ecommerce needs.</p>

                                    <h3>Original Idea</h3>
                                    <p>To create a web application to allow people to request holidays from work and then display the data to the calendar showing which days have been booked out already. This also dynamically creates a list of the booked holidays which can be removed and then automatically updates the calendar.</p>
                                    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>ASP.Net Web-forms</li>
                                        <li>C#</li>
                                        <li>Bootstrap</li>
                                        <li>HTML 5</li>
                                        <li>CSS</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h3>What I Learnt From This Project</h3>
                                    <p>Being new to ASP.Net I felt that I really learned a lot about what the technology is capable of, ways to implement my ideas but also the limitations of creating dynamic content in ASP.Net. This really helped me to push myself to overcome the issues I faced in implementing my ideas and because of that I felt that I learnt a lot about the technology.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Issues I Faced</h3>
                                    <p>When I first started this project the idea was to include multiple users with different colours representing the different departments inside the company so that an admin style account could be created that showed absence by department and then holidays could be rejected to ensure that each department had the right availability of staff needed. I then discovered that using the default calendar in ASP.Net this wouldn’t be possible due to the limitations of the DayRender function using a basic table layout that wouldn’t support multiple background colours.</p>
                                    <p>The biggest issue I faced during this project was in the way that ASP.Net uses dynamic controls. Even though they are very easy to create on the page the basic ASP.Net functionality doesn’t support returning values from dynamic controls using the default ASP.Net Web-forms controls. This meant that my dynamic list of holidays that had been booked would not return a value even if the checkbox was ticked. I overcame this issue by using the CheckBoxList class object and OOP principles to create the list as objects and then show them on the page.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>This then caused a display issue when adding and removing the items to the list and would cause multiple instances of each item to show. This was resolved by having to completely remove the CheckBoxList object from the page and then re-adding it each time the method is called which I don’t feel this is a very elegant with of resolving the issue.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>What I Would Do To Expand This Concept</h3>
                                    <p>Going forward with this project I would look to implement a database to store the data and also look to either build a better calendar myself that would support multiple events or utilise one of the open source calendars that are available. This would require a full redesign of the project and at this point I would look to increase the scope more towards a full HR administration system.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>This was the first project of its kind that was built in house for GE Money and was very well received upon launching the live version. It was subsequently rolled out at to every site in the UK and India, and was successful in ensuring that the business was compliant by the necessary date.

                                    <p>As the only developer on this project it was my responsibility to project manage, develop, test and brief the business on this project throughout the duration. For my work on this I received awards for innovation and project management.</p>
